It pivots multinational disputes and safeguards nations’ sovereignty by settling legal altercations presented to it by the Member States. It does so by considering previous treaties, international conventions and international law.</p>\n<p>The ICJ at ILYMUN will help you view conflicts from a new perspective and will offer insight on international law and the proceedings of judicial cases. The ICJ is perfect for those interested in international relations, law or simply for those who want to try something new.</p>\n<h4><strong>WHAT IS THIS YEAR’S CASE ?</strong></h4>\n<p>This year consists of two cases, each one with its own team:</p>\n<p><strong>Case 1:</strong></p>\n<p>The Russian Federation versus The United States of America,</p>\n<p>In the conflict over the alleged Russian interference in the 2016 USA elections.</p>\n<p>The two teams of advocates will represent the following groups :</p>\n<p>– Applicant party: United States of America (USA)</p>\n<p>– Respondent party: Russian Federation (Russia)</p>\n<p><strong>Case 2:</strong></p>\n<p>The Islamic Republic of Iran versus the United States of America,</p>\n<p>In the assassination of the Iranian General by US drone</p>\n<p>The two teams of advocates will represent the following groups :</p>\n<p>– Applicant party: The Islamic Republic of Iran (Iran)</p>\n<p>– Respondent party: The United States of America (USA)</p>\n<h4><strong>HOW DOES THE ICJ AT ILYMUN WORK ?</strong></h4>\n<p>The International Court of Justice is composed of:</p>\n<p>- <strong>The Presidency:</strong></p>\n<p>This year they are represented by Lisa Matimati, Belal Mohamed, Roman Harding and Vanessa Chioaru.</p>\n<p>- <strong>The Advocacy:</strong></p>\n<p>An Applicant and a Respondent party, both represented by 2 advocates each.</p>\n<p>- <strong>The Jurisdiction:</strong></p>\n<p>A court of 15-20 independent judges.</p>\n<p>Both advocate parties hold opening speeches, to present both factual and legal evidence to the judges. The judges are given time to question the advocates.</p>\n<p>Next, each advocate team presents two to four witnesses. (Witnesses are approved by the Presidents of the ICJ prior to the conference.) Advocates are given the opportunity to interview witnesses and then judges can also question the witnesses or pose questions to the advocates regarding witnesses.</p>\n<p>Then advocates present closing statements. After this, the judges deliberate upon the information presented to them and compose a verdict expressing their judgment in the case.</p>\n<h4><strong>HOW DO ADVOCATES AND JUDGES PREPARE FOR THE ICJ ?</strong></h4>\n<p><strong>Advocates</strong> need to research the case and create a report (called a memorandum). They also suggest a list of 3-4 supposed witnesses they would like to have at the trial. Finally, they create an evidence packet. The 2 parties collaborate together to create a stipulation. In sum, both teams prepare by:</p>\n<p>- Gathering evidence</p>\n<p>- Bringing in “witnesses”</p>\n<p>- Writing a stipulation, together</p>\n<p>- Writing a memorandum</p>\n<p>The Presidents of the ICJ will offer unbiased help and guidance to the</p>\n<p>advocates. They will provide templates for the various documents and work in</p>\n<p>partnership with the advocates to create and polish these documents. The</p>\n<p>Presidents will then share the documents with the opposing advocates and the</p>\n<p>judges and/or post them on the ILYMUN website for all to access once the Trial is near..</p>\n<p><strong>Judges</strong> should read the documents shared and posted by the Presidents of the ICJ to become familiar with the case, the witnesses and the evidence. It is expected that judges will act without bias, be reflective and innovative.</p>\n<p><strong>Presidents of the ICJ</strong> will also guide the judges in their <strong><em>deliberation</em></strong> to help them evaluate legal documents and assure the quality of the final verdict.</p>\n<h4><strong>HOW DO I SIGN UP FOR THE ICJ ?</strong></h4>\n<p>Delegates who want to apply to the ICJ should be confident in their level of English. Advocates in particular should be confident public speakers.</p>\n<p>Due to the challenging nature and limited places for this committee we ask delegates to apply for a role in the ICJ, by <strong>submitting a letter of motivation</strong> which explains:</p>\n<p>- Their previous MUN experiences</p>\n<p>- What makes them interested and qualified for the role</p>\n<p>Delegates should also state which role they prefer (<em>judge or advocate</em>) and if they are open to taking the <em>alternative</em> if they aren’t accepted for their first choice.</p>\n<p>Send <strong><em>any questions</em></strong> about the ICJ or <strong><em>letters of application</em></strong> before October 20 to:</p>\n<p><a href=\"mailto:Belal.mohamed@csilyon.fr\">Belal.mohamed@csilyon.fr</a> - General reference and Case 1 president</p>\n<p><a href=\"mailto:Lisa.matimati@csilyon.fr\">Lisa.matimati@csilyon.fr</a> and <a href=\"mailto:romanh@islyon.org\">romanh@islyon.org</a> - Case 2 presidents</p>","frontmatter":{"path":"/international-court-of-justice","title":"International Court of Justice"}}},"pageContext":{}},"staticQueryHashes":[]}
